Simple Chat App using socket.io , node.js , react, bcrypt and express.

Empty rooms delete themselves automatically.
Created rooms are added and sorted in room lists on the homepage.
on desktop view a room user list can be found in the chat room.
The app is responsive althought due to lack of time no major efforts were put in the styling.

This is a first draft that, due to an overcrowded timetable, was limited to a strict minimum but will be bettered after deadline.
